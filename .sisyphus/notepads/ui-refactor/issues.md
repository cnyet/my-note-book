## [2026-02-05] UI Refactoring Plan Update Issues

### Editing Challenges
- Multiple matches occurred when trying to edit the documentation references section in several tasks
- Had to use additional context lines to make edits more specific
- Duplicate entries were accidentally created in one section but were corrected

### Resolution Approaches
- Used more specific content with surrounding context lines for edits
- Carefully reviewed sections after each edit to ensure correctness
- Removed duplicate entries where discovered
- Verified that all required elements were properly added to each task

### Successful Implementation
- All 8 tasks now include the required skills
- QA procedures are consistently applied across tasks
- Design references are properly integrated into all sections
- Oracle review processes are included in all tasks
