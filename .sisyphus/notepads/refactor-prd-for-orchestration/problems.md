# Technical Debt: Single Agent Mindset

## Legacy "Single Agent" Paradigm Issues

- **Silos in Documentation**: Each capability was documented in isolation without integration protocols
- **Missing Coordination Mechanisms**: No formal procedures for cross-agent collaboration
- **Resource Management Deficits**: Uncoordinated access to shared project resources
- **Context Fragmentation**: Each agent maintained separate context without synchronization
- **Inefficient Workflows**: Sequential processing patterns instead of parallel execution models

## Resolution Status

- **CLEARED**: This technical debt in documentation has been addressed through the Multi-Agent Orchestration architecture
- **Verification**: New governance documents (AGENTS.md, project.md, implement-plan.md) now incorporate orchestration principles
- **Validation**: Cross-agent communication protocols are now formally defined and standardized
