## Critical Issues (Must Resolve Before Implementation)

### 1. WebSocket/Real-Time Counter Scope Gap
- **Severity**: High
- **Requirement**: Section 2.1.4 - "在线用户计数器（实时）"
- **Plan Status**: Plan B explicitly excludes WebSocket
- **Recommendation**: Obtain stakeholder approval for scope reduction
- **Impact**: Major feature missing from MVP if not approved

### 2. Animation/Transition Requirements Missing
- **Severity**: High
- **Requirement**: Sections 4.1-4.3 - "页面过渡动画", "平滑过渡", "动态效果"
- **Plan Status**: No specific animation implementation tasks
- **Recommendation**: Add animation tasks in Phase 1 or Phase 4
- **Impact**: User experience may not meet design requirements

### 3. SEO Optimization Incomplete
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Requirement**: Section 2.1.5 - "SEO 优化（OpenGraph、结构化数据）"
- **Plan Status**: Only mentioned in acceptance criteria, no implementation tasks
- **Recommendation**: Add SEO tasks in Phase 5 or Phase 8
- **Impact**: Reduced discoverability and social sharing capabilities

## Medium Priority Issues

### 4. Performance Acceptance Criteria Subjective
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Current**: "API 响应正常"
- **Requirement**: "API 响应时间 P95 < 200ms"
- **Recommendation**: Update验收标准 to match numeric requirement

### 5. Rate Limiting Not Implemented
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Requirement**: Section 2.2.1 - "速率限制"
- **Plan Status**: Not mentioned in tasks
- **Recommendation**: Add rate limiting middleware task

### 6. File Upload Service Fragmented
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Issue**: File upload mentioned in multiple phases (5.3, 6.3) but no dedicated service
- **Recommendation**: Create unified file upload service task

---

## Low Priority Issues

### 7. Timeline Buffer Missing
- **Severity**: Low
- **Issue**: 21-28天 schedule has no buffer for delays
- **Recommendation**: Add 2-3 day buffer or define milestone checkpoints

### 8. Labs Real-Time Features Gap
- **Severity**: Low
- **Requirement**: "在线用户计数器（实时）" in Section 2.1.4
- **Plan Status**: Only static Labs list implemented
- **Recommendation**: Clarify if real-time features are deferred

## Consistency Issues Between Documents

| Item | Requirement | Plan | Status |
|------|-------------|------|--------|
| Backend Language | Unspecified | Python FastAPI | ✅ Documented |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Redis | SQLite | ✅ Documented |
| OAuth Email Verification | Included | Excluded | ✅ Documented |
| Initial Data | Ready | Need creation | ✅ Documented |
| WebSocket | Required | Excluded | ❌ Needs approval |

---

## Recommendations Summary

### Immediate (Before Starting)
- [ ] Get stakeholder sign-off on WebSocket scope reduction
- [ ] Add animation implementation tasks
- [ ] Clarify Labs real-time requirements

### During Implementation
- [ ] Add SEO tasks to Phase 5 or 8
- [ ] Implement rate limiting in Phase 2 or 8
- [ ] Create unified file upload service

### Process Improvements
- [ ] Add milestone checkpoints
- [ ] Define technical debt tracking
- [ ] Update performance验收标准 with numeric values

## Positive Findings

✅ Requirements document is well-structured and comprehensive
✅ Plan covers 95%+ of requirements with specific, actionable tasks
✅ Technical stack choices are justified and documented
✅ Task decomposition is reasonable for 1-2 person team
✅ Acceptance criteria are mostly objective and measurable
✅ Design document references are complete

---

## Verdict: APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS

The PRD and implementation plan are of high quality. The main risks are:
1. Scope reduction (WebSocket) needs formal approval
2. Animation requirements need implementation tasks
3. SEO optimization needs dedicated tasks

Address High priority issues before starting Phase 1.
