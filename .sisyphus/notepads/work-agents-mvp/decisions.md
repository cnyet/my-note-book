## 2026-02-01: Consolidated Workflow Rules

### Decision
Consolidated workflow rules from docs/guides/workflow-rules.md into docs/implement/implement-plan.md to eliminate redundancy.

### Context
- Original workflow-rules.md contained execution confirmation rules and verification workflows
- These rules were already integrated into the implementation plan
- To prevent information duplication and maintain single source of truth, the separate file was removed

### Outcome
- All workflow rules now exist in implement-plan.md under the "工作流程说明" section
- Redundant file removed to maintain documentation consistency
- Single authoritative source for workflow rules maintained
